Loops in java are used to execute a particular part of the program repeatedly until the condition to be true.
->there are three loops. 1.For loop 2.while loop 3.do-while loop
1.For loop
public class kn {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        int a=1;
        for(int i=1;i<a;i++){
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}
}
2.while loop
public class kn {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        int a=10;
        while(a>5)
        {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}
}
3.do-while loop
public class kn {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        int a=10;
        do{
            System.out.println("Hello");
        }
        while(a<5);
        
    }
}

How is the do while loop is different from for and while loop?
->do while loop is an exit control loop that means the condition will checked once the control tries to exit the loop so, dowhile loop will be excuted atleasat once even 
condition is false.
->for and while loop, the condition is checked when the control tries to enter the loop So,if initial condition is false control will come outside the loop
