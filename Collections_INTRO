COLLECTION:
->Collection is a group of objects.Ex:List,set,Queue

Collection Framework: 
->Java Collections are Set of Interfaces and Classes in Java. Collection frameworks provides impementation of Data Stuctures and algorithms by which we can store and process
information without implementing them .These are present in java.util package, It offers wide range of data Stuctures like lists,set maps,queues,along with algorithms for
common operations like seraching and sorting.
KEY COMPONENTS:
->Interfaces: Collection, List, Set, Queue, Map
->Implementations:These are classes that implement Interfaces EX: ArrayList, LinkedList, hashSet, TreeSet, hashMap, TreeMap, PriorityQueue and ArrayDeque
->Algorithms:Searching nd Sorting

Array and Collection:
->Array is static and fixed size
->Collection is dynamic - size grows and shrinks with insertions and deletions. 
LIST: index based,allow duplicates
SET : not index based, Does not allow duplicates
MAP : Not index based ,Stores element using keys.Keys must be unique, elements can be duplicated
