Problem Statement

You need to develop a simple Java application to convert a decimal number to its binary equivalent.
A decimal number can be converted to binary by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainders. The binary equivalent is the sequence of remainders read
from bottom to top.
Task: Convert a Given Decimal Number to Binary
Use Scanner to take user input for the decimal number.
Use a loop to convert the decimal number to binary by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and storing the remainders.
Print the binary equivalent.
Expected Output:
Input: 18
Output: The binary equivalent of 10 is 1010.
Input: 15
Output: The binary equivalent of 15 is 1111.
 Input: 23
Output: The binary equivalent of 23 15 10111.
#code
import java.util.Scanner;
public class binary {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("enter a number");
        int num=sc.nextInt();
        int k=num;
        String bin="";
        while(num>0){
            int rem=num%2;
            bin=rem+bin;
            num=num/2;
        }
        System.out.println(bin);

    }
    
}


2.You need to develop a simple Java application to print the Fibonacci series up to a given number.
Fibonacci Series Explanation:
The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. For example, the Fibonacci series
up to 10 is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.
Task: Print the Fibonacci Series Up to a Given Number
• Use Scanner to take user input for the maximum number.
• Use a loop to generate the Fibonacci series.
Print each number in the series until the series reaches or exceeds the given number.
Expected Output:
Input: 10
Output: Fibonacci series up to 10:01 12358
Input: 21
Output: Fibonacci series up to 21:01 1 2 3 5 8 13 21

import java.util.*;
public class series {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("enter range of the series");
        int range=sc.nextInt();
        int a=0;
        int b=1;
        System.out.println(a + " ");
        System.out.println("Fibonacci series upto " +range + " is :");
          while(a<=range){
           int fibo=a+b;
            System.out.print(fibo + " ");
            a=b;
            b=fibo;


        }
    }
    
}
