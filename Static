Static keyword:
->if we make a variable as static it will be same for all object irrespective of what object is we r using.
->when we have static keyword use class name or object name, both will work ...we will prefer to have class name
->to access static variable we dont need object, thtas why main method is static
Non-satic variable: A variable which is different for ll objects
->We can only access static keyword inside the static method only.
- >Static member is accessed without creating object.
EX:
package demo;
public class StaticDemo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println(practice.x);
		practice.fun1();
		practice pra=new practice();
		pra.fun2();
	}
}
class practice{
	static int x=10;   //static variable
	public static void fun1() {
		System.out.println("Boy is playing games");
	}
	int y=20;
	public void fun2() {
		System.out.println("Girl is playing");
	}
}
Static variable: static int x=100; //it is independent object nd we can use this by class name as well as object
int b=20; //dependent of object and we can use this by object

Static methos:
->we can use static variable inside the static method but not non-static methods, bjut we hve obj ref then we can use non-static

Static -Block:
->s.b call only once irrespective of how mny objects will be craeted
